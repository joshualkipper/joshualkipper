## Hello, I'm Joshua Kipper!

- I'm an undergraduate student in Physics at [UFRGS](http://www.ufrgs.br/ufrgs/inicial).
- I'm currently studying the detection of exoplanets using the planetary transit method.
- Here are some projects developed in computational physics disciplines, as well as projects developed for research.
